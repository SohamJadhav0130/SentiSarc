# SentiSarc
Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis Project repository! This project focuses on sentiment analysis of customer feedback from social media platforms using NLP techniques. The goal is to identify sentiment, including sarcasm, in comments and the captions. It can be used on regular sentences too.
